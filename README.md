# Titanic Data Analysis & Visualization  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** using Python. The goal is to find patterns in the data and understand which factors affected passenger survival.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset comes from [Kaggle’s Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes details like:  
-  PassengerId
-  Survived
-  Pclass
-  Name
-  Sex
-  Age
-  SibSp
-  Parch
-  Ticket
-  Fare
-  Cabin
-  Embarked	 

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **NumPy** – for handling numerical data  

## 📊 Analysis & Insights  
✔ Checked missing values and handled them  
✔ Explored survival rates based on gender, class, and age  
✔ Created bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to show insights  
✔ Found that women and first-class passengers had higher survival rates

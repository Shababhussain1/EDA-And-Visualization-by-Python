# Titanic Data Analysis & Visualization  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project explores the famous **Titanic dataset** using Python. The goal is to find patterns in the data and understand which factors affected passenger survival.  

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset  
The dataset comes from [Kaggleâ€™s Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes details like:  
- Passenger age  
- Gender  
- Ticket class  
- Survival status  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Pandas** â€“ for data cleaning and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ for data visualization  
- **NumPy** â€“ for handling numerical data  

## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Insights  
âœ” Checked missing values and handled them  
âœ” Explored survival rates based on gender, class, and age  
âœ” Created bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to show insights  
âœ” Found that women and first-class passengers had higher survival rates
